# -Local-Food-Marketplace-
The Local Food Marketplace is a digital web platform designed to directly connect local farmers with consumers and restaurants, eliminating middlemen and creating a transparent, fair, and sustainable food supply network.

problem statement
Small-scale farmers often struggle to sell their produce at fair prices due to the presence of intermediaries and limited access to reliable marketplaces. These middlemen reduce farmersâ€™ profits, leaving them with minimal earnings for their hard work. On the other hand, consumers and restaurants increasingly demand fresh, locally sourced, and organic food, but face difficulties in finding trustworthy local suppliers.

#solution
To address these challenges, the Local Food Marketplace project proposes the creation of a digital platform that directly connects local farmers with consumers and restaurants, eliminating the need for middlemen.
This platform allows farmers to:

Create their own profiles and online stores, showcasing their farms, available produce, and prices.

Manage inventory and sales through an easy-to-use dashboard.

Receive direct orders from buyers and communicate with them instantly.
